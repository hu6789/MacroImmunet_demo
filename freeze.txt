MacroImmunet – Label Center
Phase 1 Interface Freeze Declaration

Status: Phase 1 completed
Applicable versions: v0.1.0-alpha and later
Freeze level: Semantic Freeze

Purpose of the Freeze

The Label Center is the only global state hub in MacroImmunet. It is responsible for:

continuous fields

sparse labels / particles

ownership management

tick-level transactional consistency

During Phase 1, its temporal semantics, conflict resolution rules, and consistency guarantees were systematically verified through tests.

Therefore, from the completion of Phase 1 onward:

The Label Center is treated as a long-term stable infrastructure layer.
All subsequent modules (ScanMaster, CellMaster, plugins) must adapt to its semantics, rather than driving changes in its behavior.

Scope of the Freeze

2.1 What is frozen: externally observable semantics

Tick-level transactional semantics (Step 5.12)

All write operations (emit, claim, release, modify):

are not visible within the same tick

become effective only after apply() at the tick boundary

Within a single tick:

repeated reads return a consistent view

writes do not affect reads

Guarantee:
The Label Center behaves like a snapshot-consistent system within each tick.

Hysteresis and cooldown semantics (Step 5.13)

Reclaim, merge, and prune operations:

do not occur in the triggering tick

are constrained by cooldown and hysteresis rules

This prevents labels or fields from oscillating across adjacent ticks.

Guarantee:
State transitions have temporal inertia rather than instantaneous flips.

Ownership conflict arbitration semantics (Step 5.14)

Within the same tick:

multiple claims on the same label are resolved deterministically

For owned labels:

emits are ignored

a released label cannot be immediately re-claimed

Ownership transfer:

only takes effect across ticks

Guarantee:
There is no preemptive or race-based ownership behavior.

2.2 What is not frozen (allowed to change)

The following aspects may be modified or optimized as long as the above semantics are preserved:

internal data structures

storage and indexing strategies

performance optimizations

internal logging and debug hooks

non-semantic API organization

Contract for Upper Layers

3.1 ScanMaster and CellMaster

They must not:

assume that writes take effect immediately

rely on ownership changes within the same tick

They must:

interact with the Label Center via intents or requests

tolerate emits or claims being ignored or delayed

3.2 Plugins and extensions

Plugins must not:

bypass the Label Center to modify global state directly

assume immediate visibility of their own writes

assume ownership can be preempted

Plugins may:

read summaries or snapshots

generate intents

observe effects in subsequent ticks

Conclusion:
Plugins are sources of strategy, not sources of state.

Freeze Level Definition

This freeze is a semantic freeze.

This means:

behavioral meaning remains stable

conflict resolution rules remain stable

temporal consistency guarantees remain stable

It does not guarantee that:

API names remain unchanged

internal implementations remain unchanged

Phase 1 Closure

At this point, the Label Center:

has passed comprehensive unit and boundary tests

is stable under concurrent dependencies from multiple modules

serves as a solid foundation for Phase 2 integration and plugin systems

Phase 1 is formally closed.
